    - 2015-11-30:
      - 'mitaka-1': >
          Dec 1-3 is the mitaka-1 milestone window for projects following the
          release:cycle-with-milestones model.
    - 2016-01-16:
      - 'mitaka-2': >
          Jan 19-21 is the mitaka-2 milestone window for projects following the
          release:cycle-with-milestones model.
    - 2016-02-29:
      - 'mitaka-3': >
          Libraries that are not client libraries (Oslo and others) should
          issue their final release during this week. That allows to give time
          for last-minute changes before feature freeze.
      - 'Feature freeze': >
          The mitaka-3 milestone marks feature freeze for projects following
          the release:cycle-with-milestones model. No featureful patch should
          be landed after this point. Exceptions may be granted by the project
          PTL.
      - 'Final release for client libraries': >
          Client libraries should issue their final release during this week,
          to match feature freeze.
      - 'Soft StringFreeze': >
          You are no longer allowed to accept proposed changes containing
          modifications in user-facing strings. Such changes should be rejected
          by the review team and postponed until the next series development
          opens (which should happen when RC1 is published).
    - 2016-03-14:
      - 'RC1 target week': >
          The week of March 14-18 is the target date for projects following the
          release:cycle-with-milestones model to issue their first release
          candidate.
      - 'Hard StringFreeze': >
          This happens when the RC1 for the project is tagged. At this point,
          ideally no strings are changed (or added, or removed), to give
          translator time to finish up their efforts.
    - 2016-03-28:
      - 'Final RCs and intermediary releases': >
          The week of March 28 to April 1st is the last week to issue release
          candidates or intermediary releases before release week. On release
          week only final-release-critical releases will be accepted (at the
          discretion of the release team).
    - 2016-04-08:
      - 'Mitaka release': >
          The Mitaka coordinated release will happen on April 7th.
